### Scope and Usage

The OrthovisionAIBinary profile addresses the specific need for AI-powered DICOM tag classification in medical workflows. Typically, this profile is used for handling content such as:

* Orthodontic photographs (frontal, profile, smile views) taken with DSLR cameras (JPEG, PNG, JPEG 2000 formats)
* Legacy radiographic images digitized from acetate films and stored as TIFF files for archive conversion
* Audio recordings from medical devices (e.g., heart sounds, respiratory sounds) in WAV or MP3 formats that require DICOM encapsulation
* Scanned medical documents and imaging reports stored as TIFF files needing proper DICOM classification
* Historical medical imaging datasets in various formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG) preserved for research purposes

Unlike general Binary resources, this profile enforces non-empty data requirements essential for reliable AI processing.
