### Scope and Usage

The OrthovisionAIBinary profile addresses the specific need for AI-powered image classification in medical workflows. Typically, this profile is used for handling content such as:

* Orthodontic photographs (frontal, profile, smile views)
* Intraoral radiographs and photographs
* PA and Lateral cephalograms

The OrthovisionAIBinary resource ensures that medical images are properly formatted and validated before submission to AI classification services. Unlike general Binary resources, this profile restricts content types to medically relevant formats (JPEG, PNG, JPEG 2000, DICOM) and enforces non-empty data requirements essential for reliable AI processing.
