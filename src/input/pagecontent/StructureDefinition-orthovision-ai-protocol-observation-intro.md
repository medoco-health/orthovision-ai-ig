### Scope and Usage

The OrthovisionAIProtocolObservation profile provides specialized classification of orthodontic imaging protocols, addressing the specific needs of orthodontic practice where image positioning and view angles are critical for clinical assessment.

The classification is particularly valuable for:
* Automated image sorting and organization
* Treatment progress monitoring
* Clinical documentation completeness

Unlike modality classification which uses standard DICOM codes, protocol classification uses specialized terminology developed for orthodontic workflows, providing more granular and clinically relevant categorization for orthodontic practitioners.
